RSPEC and Capybara
-write out the scenario in a test file
-First step - feature will fail
-build the features one by one till the test passes

*************************************************
Process for creating articles feature test and feature
-Install the RSpec and Capybara gems  

    ** Best practice is to clone a branch***
- Create a branch to do the developement work
- write the feature test
- Build the feature to make the test pass one by one
- Once the feature test passes with no errors - merge Branch with the master

expectations: 

- Visit root page
- click on new article
- fill in title
- fill in body
- create article

expectation:

- Article has been created
- articles patn

lecture notes

Text lecture - install RSpec and Capybara
Install RSpec and Capybara

In the Gemfile add the needed gems in their specific groups as follows:

group :development, :test do 
gem 'rspec-rails', '3.1.0'
end

group :test do
gem 'capybara', '2.7.1'
end

Then run:
bundle install

Now run the rspec install generator:
rails generate rspec:install

Generate a stub for RSpec:
bundle binstubs rspec-core

Make a git commit and push to Github:
git add -A
git commit -m "Setup RSpec and Capybara"
git push


************************************************************
Text lecture - create article feature test
Create Article Feature Test -

Create a topic branch:
git checkout -b article-feature-success

Create a folder called features under spec directory:
mkdir spec/features

In that folder create a new file called creating_article_spec.rb: 
Open that file and add the following:

****require "rails_helper" ***** must always be included as it sets up Capybara-Rails integration in spec/rails_helper.rb:
require 'capybara/rspec' is also needed to set up Capybara-RSpec integration in spec/spec_helper.rbc
***
RSpec.feature "Creating Articles" do 
scenario "A user creates a new article" do
visit "/"
click_link "New Article"
fill_in "Title", with: "Creating a blog" 
fill_in "Body", with: "Lorem Ipsum" 
click_button "Create Article"

expect(page).to have_content("Article has been created")
expect(page.current_path).to eq(articles_path) 
end
end

Now save the file type this to run the spec (or you can just type rspec to run all specs):
rspec spec/features/creating_article_spec.rb

You get a routing error that suggests to create a root path
Update the routes.rb file in the config folder like below:
root to: "articles#index"

Now save and run rspec spec/features/creating_article_spec.rb
again.
You get an error that says: Uninitialized constant ArticlesController. This suggests to create the Articles Controller

Generate an articles controller with an index action by issuing the following command:
rails g controller articles index

Remove the get 'articles/index' line from the routes.rb file

Saveï¿¼ and run rspec again. 
The next error message suggests to add the "New Article" link
